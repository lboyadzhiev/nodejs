    Should our code be in one file?

    Yes and No!

    we will run one file, but code will be splited in modules.

    If we want to share some info go to the file where is it and in "module" we have and object called 'export'

        module.export = {object name}

    In the file where we want to take it we use require('./pathNmae') - alwais need to start with '.'.

    !!!! When import module we actually invoke it;
